This is a homework excersice number 0 for OOP class.
The purpose of the project is to implement an ON-LINE elevator allocation algorithm primarily focusing on object oriented programming.
There are few aspects of good algorithm such as average waiting time for call, number of unhandled calls. A good algorithm seeks to minimize these aspects.
This project advances to accomplish the goal of being a good algorithm while the code should be asthetic and simple to understand.
Also Our project attemps to make the whole problem more abstract by dividing the responsibilities between classes.
When trying to implement our originally written algorithm we found out that it is not clear rather hard to understand and time consuming.
Therefore we've written a simple algorithm to make implementation easier. We've learned from this that under time pressure its better to look for simpler solutions and to trade
off few seconds of average waiting time per call for more time to complete the whole task.
